# Lexical-Analyzer
 The first stage of a compiler. The analyzer reads the source code character by character to identify tokens. It then creates a symbol table and token classification table. The analyzer uses a table-driven process to make it easy to update with little to no additional work. As conditions are not hard-coded.
